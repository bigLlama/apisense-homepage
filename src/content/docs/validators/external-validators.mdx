# External validators

These validators are external programs taking in definition and response data as JSON and returning the validation result.
They are user created and have no limitations except the in- and output.

## Templates

To ease the creation of custom validators there are templates for many languages.

### Official templates

The official templates are found in the repositories of the Buonotti GitHub organization. They have the following naming convention

```
validator-template-<lang>
```

Where `lang` is the name of the language the validator is for

### Installing templates

Templates are managed with the Apisense CLI. They can be installed using the following command

```bash
apisense templates update
```

This updates all installed validator and auto-discovers and installs official templates.&#x20;

To install an unofficial template you can run the following command

```bash
apisense template add --lang <lang> --url <git_url>
```

This allows to add a custom Git repository as a source for a validator template for a custom language.&#x20;

<Aside type="caution">
    Languages are unique so if you want to add more than one validator for a language make sure to name them differently
