## Where it started

The project idea was born from a presentation of [Martin Rabanser](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinrabanser/) at our school
[TFO Max Valier](https://tfobz.it) in Bozen, South Tyrol - Italy.

The presentation was about the [OpenDataHub](https://opendatahub.com), a provider of open data in our region and as part of the presentation Martin highlighted an issue the OpenDataHub had: Some data coming from sensors was missing or even incorrect.

This problem lead to the birth of the Apisense project. Early on we planned it to be only for the specific use case of the OpenDataHub but very soon we realized we could develop a solution way more universal adoptable.

## The ideology

We developed Apisense with these core concepts in mind 

- Plug and play 
- Extensible
- Accessible

### Plug and play 

Apisense is kept to only be one executable binary. The user still has to add definition files but except that all the functionality is available from the get-go and without having to configure users, firewall, system daemons, etc.

### Extensible 

The goal is to deliver something being more of a framework than anything else. We provide the basic components everyone will need like handling of unavailable endpoints and schema mismatch, but above that it is left to the user to define what is ok and what not.

This a very important point and we will add more features in the future to make this process even easier (see [Roadmap](/developemnt/roadmap)).

### Accessible

The last key point is making Apisense as eccessible as possible, meaning having multiple ways to interact with the platform and thus having many ways to integrate Apisense into existing workflows.

### Contact 

If you want to submit a bug report or a new feature please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/buonotti/apisense/issues/new).
