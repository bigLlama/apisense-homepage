# Schema

## Example

The format will be illustrated using the [example](https://github.com/buonotti/apisense/blob/dev/examples/apisense\_demo.apisensedef.yml) available in our GitHub repository:

```yaml title="apisense_demo.apisensedef.yml"
# The version of the spec.
version: 1

# The name of the endpoint (used in the report)
name: "apisense_demo"

# The format of the response (json or xml). Default json
format: "json"

# The endpoint to call. Variables can be interpolated with {{ .ParamName }} (Go template syntax)
# There are also two builtin functions: Now and Env
# Now is used with the following syntax: {{ .Now "<format>" }} you can find the format here: https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time.Format
# Env is used with the following syntax: {{ .Env "<env_var_name>" }}
base_url: 'http://localhost:8080/restricted'

# Query parameters to add to the request. You can interpolate variables in the value of each query parameter
# query_parameters:
#   - name: "limit"
#     value: 33

# Variable definitions
# For all non-constant variables, the number of values must be the same and will be used in order to call the endpoint
# variables:
#   - name: "Name"
#     constant: false
#     values:
#       - "Name1"
#       - 'Name2'
#
#   - name: "ApiVersion"
#     constant: true
#     values:
#       - "2"

# Set names for each test case generated. The length has to match the length of the variable variables length (in this example 2)
# If left empty the test cases are named TestCase1, TestCase2, ...
test_case_names:
  - "default"
# - "Name2Test"

# Sets the HTTP-Method which is used. Allowed values are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
method: 'GET'

# Holds an arbitrary payload to send to the api. You can interpolate variables here 
# payload:
#   test_data: {{ .FancyNumber }}

# Ok code is the expected status code. Defaults to 200 if it is omitted
ok_code: 200

# List of names of validators that should not be run. Keep in mind that external validators are named with external.<name>
# to better symbolize that they are external
excluded_validators:
    - "external.data-hole"

# Set the Authorization header to a given value 
# authorization: "My-Secret-Api-Key"

# Optional information to add a jwt authentication method.
# Note that the token is requested on each request sent
jwt_login:
  # The endpoint that provides the token
  url: 'http://localhost:8080/login'
  # The object sent to the api. It can have any structure. 
  # You can interpolate variables from the secrets file using the same templating language. The Env function is also supported
  login_payload: 
      username: '{{ .Username }}'
      password: '{{ .Password }}'
  # Name of the top-level json key that contains the token. Nested structures are not yet supported
  token_key_name: "token"

# Add additional headers to the request. The Authorization header gets overrideen if it is set using the authorization property or the jwt_login property
headers:
  Test-Header: "1231313"

# The expected response schema. Must be a valid json-schema
response_schema:
  type: object 
  properties:
    text: 
      type: string 
    manyNumbers:
      type: array 
      items:
        type: number
    nestedData:
      type: object 
      properties:
        someText:
          type: string
        someOtherText:
          type: string
```

Now let's go over the fields in the definition file

## Fields

### `version (required)`

The version field specifies the version of the definition file. Currently, the latest version is version 1

### `name (required)`

The name is a unique identifier for the definition. It must be unique and should be somewhat declarative.
Preferably someone should know by the name and the context which endpoint will be monitored just by looking at the name.

### `format (required)`

This field specifies the response format the API returns.
Currently, the following formats are supported

* JSON
* YAML

### `base_url (required)`

:::tip[Templates available]
Templates are available here
:::

This field contains the base URL of the request, meaning the requested path without query parameters.

#### Example

Let's say you want to monitor the following endpoint

```
https://example.com/notes?completed=true
```

Then the base URL of the definition would be the following

```
https://example.com/notes
```

### `query_parameters`

:::tip[Templates available]
Templates are available in the `value` field of each item
:::

This is a list of query parameters to add to the [#base\_url](#base\_url-required "mention").
Each one is a pair of name and value

#### Example

```yaml
query_parameters:
- name: completed
  value: '{{ .Completed }}'
- name: limit
  value: '10'
```

This would result in the `Completed` variable being inserted into the `completed` query parameter
and would result in a URL looking like this

```
<base_url>?completed=<value_of_Completed>&limit=10
```

### `variables`

In the variable section of the definition file you can define two types of variables.

* Constant
* Not Constant

These variables lead to the creation of so-called test cases.
For each definition file All test cases are run and the results are added to the report.

:::caution
Test cases are generated regardless if the variable is being used or not
:::

#### Constant variables

Constant variables have only one constant value and keep their value throughout all test cases

#### Non constant variables

Non-constant variables are variables with multiple values.
Keep in mind, that the number of values for non-constant variables must not differ for any variable.
The amount of values in a non-constant variable declaration determines how many test cases there are.

#### Example

A set of variables could look something like this

```yaml
variables:
- name: ApiVersion
  constant: true
  values:
  - "2"
- name: Owner
  constant: false
  values:
  - "Sepp"
  - ""
```

And their use in the [#base\_url](#base\_url-required "mention") field like this

```
https://example.com/api/v{{ .ApiVersion }}/notes
```

With these query parameters

```
query_parameters:
- name: owner
  value: {{ .Owner }}
```

This will lead to the creation of two test cases, because the non-constant variables have two values each (in this example there is only one)

The test cases will look like this

```
https://example.com/api/v2/notes?owner=Sepp
```

```
https://example.com/api/v2/notes?owner=
```

### `test_case_names`

Each test case that gets generated will also get a human-readable name.
If this field is not set all test cases will be named `TestCaseN` where `N` is the number of test case starting at one

If you want to assign your own names you can populate this array with names for all test cases.
It is important that the number of names in this list matches the amount of generated test cases

### `method`

This field sets the HTTP method of the requests. By default, this is a GET request.
Currently, the following HTTP methods are allowed

* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE

### `payload`

:::caution
Only available on POST or PUT requests
:::

:::tip[Templates available]
Templates are available in any value field of the object
:::

This can contain an arbitrary object that can be serialized to JSON to send along the request

### `ok_code`

This field defines which code to expect in case of success. If not set defaults to `200 (OK)`

### `excluded_validators`

This is a list of validators to skip in the validation process. They will still show up in the report as skipped

### `authorization`

Use this field to override the value of the Authorization HTTP header.
Takes precedence over [#headers](#headers "mention") but gets overridden by [#jwt\_login](#jwt\_login "mention")

### `jwt_login`

This field can be used to define a JWT authentication procedure

#### `url`

This field sets the endpoint to send the login request to

#### `login_paylaod`

:::tip[Templates available]
Secrets templates are available in any value field of the object
:::

This contains an arbitrary JSON serializable object to send along the login request containing probably the credentials

#### `token_key_name`

:::danger
Nested structures are not supported yet
:::

This contains the name of the top-level property of the response object where the JWT token resides.

#### Example

An example setup could look like this

```yaml
jwt_login:
  url: https://example.com/auth/login # Is always POST
  login_payload:
    username: {{ .Username }}
    password: {{ .Password }}
  token_key_name: token
```

In this example a following request will be sent

```
POST https://example.com/auth/login
```

```json title=payload.json
{
    "username": "<value_of_Username>",
    "password": "<value_of_Password>"
}
```

A response like this is expected

```json title=response.json
{
    "token": "<jwt_token>"
}
```

Check out [Secrets](/definitions/secrets) on how to use secrets to hide sensitive login data in your definition

### `headers`

Here you can add additional headers to add to each request

#### Example

Let's say you want to add a custom header called `AwesomeHeader`. Then the field would look like this

```yaml
headers:
    AwesomeHeader: "Awesome!"
```

### `response_schema`

:::note
It is recommended to check values of the response using validators and not json-schema
:::

This field contains the expected response schema on a successful request.
The schema is in the form of the [json-schema specification](https://json-schema.org/)

## Templating

Some parts in the definition support Go templates. Other than the variables
defined by the user and default template constructs there are also
some built-in functions that can be used in the templates

### Built-in functions

The apisense definition template has also two build in functions you can use

* Now
* Env

#### Now

Now is a function that takes as an argument a valid [go time format string](https://pkg.go.dev/time#Time.Format) and prints out the current time in the provided format upon templating.

Note that the templating happens each time the daemon does a validation cycle.

#### Env

Env takes in a string and prints out the value of the environment variable with the given key. If the key does not exist, the function prints a empty string.
