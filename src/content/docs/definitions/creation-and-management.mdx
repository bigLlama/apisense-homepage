# Creation and management

Definitions are files that reside in the Apisense definitions directory.

The definitions directory is located in the Apisense app directory which itself is located in the users home directory.

## Create a definition file

### Locally

There are several ways of creating new definition files.

#### CLI

You can use the following command to create a new definition with a given name

```bash
apisense definition create <name>
```

This creates a definition in the definitions folder in your system containing the required boilerplate to get started

#### Import from a OpenAPI spec

This method is very handy if you have a lot of endpoints or you don't want to write the required boilerplate yourself

The command to do this is the following

```bash
apisense definition import --spec <spec> <spec_file>
```

Currently both OpenAPI v2 (Swagger) and OpenAPI v3.x specifications are supported for importing. The file can be either a JSON or YAML file containing a valid OpenAPI spec. By default the command will only print the converted definitions, you can specify to save them to disk by passing the `--write` flag. Check out the help menu of the command for all available flags.

#### Manual

To create a definition manually simply create a new file ending in `.apisensedef.yml`. The contents of the file must contain all the required fields. See [schema.md](schema.md "mention") for the full details

```bash
touch "$HOME"/.local/share/apisense/definitions/mydefinition.apisensedef.yml
```

### Remotely

You can also create a definition file via the Apisense API. Just post the definition to the definitions endpoint to create the definition file in remote. Check out the API section to learn more about the available endpoints

## List all definition files

To list all the definitions simply list all the files in the definitions directory or use the following command. The API also provides an endpoint to list all definitions.

```bash
apisense definition ls
```

## Disabling and enabling of definition files

The config has a dedicated field for enabling and disabling definitions: The `ignore_prefix` field. This field in the config contains the character sequence that, when put in front of a definition file, will cause the file to be disabled.

If you list the definitions using the CLI, the program will tell you whether a definition is enabled or not.

To disable a definition you can manually rename the file or use the following CLI command

```bash
apisense definition disable bluetooth.apisensedef.yml
```

To enable the definition file just rename the file or use the enable command. Note that in this example the `ignore_prefix` field is set to the default value of: `_`

```bash
apisense definition enable _bluetooth.apisensedef.yml
```
