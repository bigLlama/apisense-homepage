# Secrets

<Aside type="caution">
    Currently secrets are only available in select fields
</Aside>

Secrets can be used to hide/decouple secrets from the definitions (ex. gitignore them).

The secrets file must have the same name of the definition name and end
in `.secrets.yml` instead of `.apisensedef.yml`. The secrets file does not support nested structures, only top-level key-value pairs.

The secrets file is automatically loaded into the definition and where supported the secrets can be used same as variables in definition
