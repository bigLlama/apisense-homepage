import {LinkCard, TabItem, Tabs} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Before getting started make sure you install Apisense

<LinkCard title="Install" href="/get-started/install"/>

First you will have to initialize Apisense. This ensures all directories and files needed are set up.
To do this run the following command in your shell

```bash
apisense init
```

To start monitoring endpoints it's as simple as starting the Apisense daemon

```bash
apisense daemon start
```

This command will start the daemon in your current shell and start to generate report files.

You will notice that the daemon warns about definitions missing. This is because we have not created any definition files
to tell Apisense what to monitor.

## Our first definition file

### Creation

Definition files are what we use to know what to monitor.
You can create a new definition file by running the following command in your shell

```bash
apisense definition create myFirstDefinition
```

The program will tell you where the new definition was created.
By default, Apisense saves definitions to the following path

<Tabs syncKey="os">
    <TabItem label="Linux">
        ```
        $HOME/.local/share/apisense/definitions
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Windows">
        ```
        %appdata%\apisense\definitions
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you navigate to that folder you will notice a new file named `myFirstDefinition.apisensedef.yml`. Let's see what this file contains


```yaml title=myFirstDefinition.apisensedef.yml
version: 1
name: "myFirstDefinition"
# base_url: TODO
test_case_names:
  - "default"
# response_schema: TODO
```

### A sneak peek at the definition format

The first thing that you probably noted is that the file ends in `.apisensedef.yml`. This is the mandatory extension for all Apisense definitions.

The file is in the YAML markup language.
It is very similar to JSON in structure but has more human-readable syntax.
The first field `version` specifies the version of the definition.
As of now this is version 1

The name field is the name for this definition.
This name must be unique across all definitions, and it is also recommended to have it match the filename.

The `base_url` field contains the path to the endpoint without the query parameters (you can add those later).
This is a required field along the `version and name` fields.

The `test_case_names` field can be used to give your test cases a human-readable name.
This is not required.
If you are wondering what test cases are check out the !!TODO!! section.

Last but not least we have to tell Apisense what the response should look like.
If your endpoint has no response this is not needed, if it does we have to add the response schema here.

The response schema adheres to the [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/) spec.
If you are not accustomed to it, no problem. Let's take a look at an example

Let's assume we have an endpoint responding with the following response

```json
{
    "name": "sepp",
    "surname": "hintner",
    "age": 69,
    "favouriteFood": [
        "pizza",
        "speck"
    ],
    "school": {
        "name": "TFO Max Valier",
        "city": "Bozen"
    }
}
```

The schema of this JSON object would look like this

```yaml
response_schema:
    type: object
    properties:
        name:
            type: string
        surname:
            type: string
        age:
            type: number
        favouriteFood:
            type: array
            items:
                type: string
        school:
            type: object
            properties:
                name:
                    type: string
                city:
                    type: string
```

The schema basically lists all properties and for each one specifies the type.
Check out the json-schema website and the `examples/` folder in the repository to know more.

If you are not sure if you have made a mistake and don't want to blow up production
you can use the following command to have your definition validated for correctness

```bash
apisense definition check /path/to/my/awesome/definition.apisensedef.yml
```

Now you can either wait for the next daemon cycle to see your definition in action or just run a one-shot validation with

```bash
apisense validate
```
