# Installation

## Release Binaries

The easiest way of installing Apisense as of now is downloading the binary for your system
on our [GitHub release page](https://github.com/buonotti/apisense/releases/)

## Go install

<Aside>
    For this step you need the go toolchain on your system.

    Check out the [official docs](https://go.dev/doc/install) on how to install go
</Aside>

You can install the binary with go install by running the following command in your shell

```bash
go install github.com/buonotti/apisense@latest
```

This command will install the latest available version to `"$GOPATH"/bin`.
To know where go stores its files run the following command

```bash
go env GOPATH
```

## Build from source

<Aside>
    For this step you need the go toolchain on your system.
    Also as optional dependencies we recommend having make and [go-swag](https://github.com/swaggo/swag) installed.

You can also build the project from source.
To do that first clone the repository then run the `go build` command to produce the `apisense` executable.
You can then also run `go install` to install the binary to `"$GOPATH/bin"`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/buonotti/apisense
cd apisense
go build
go install
```

Optionally you can also do the same steps by running `make`

To install the binary to `$GOPATH/bin` run

```shell
make
```

Or to just build the binary run

```shell
make build
```

If you want to regenerate the OpenApi spec run `swag init` in the root of the project
